# Octagon Staffing Plan Generator Prototype - Design Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the design for Octagon's Staffing Plan Generator Prototype (Phase 1 - "Crawl"). The prototype demonstrates how AI can read heterogeneous SOW documents and normalize details into structured staffing plans using semantic intelligence and rules-based processing.

## Problem Statement

**Current Challenge**: Octagon manually builds staffing plans by interpreting client SOWs (Scope of Work documents). Every SOW is different â€” some specify % FTE, some hours, some rates, some use vague language. Converting this into a structured staffing plan requires significant time and institutional knowledge.

**Prototype Goal**: Show that AI can reliably extract and normalize SOW details into structured data that maps to staffing plans, handling the variability inherent in client documents.

## Solution Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Octagon-Specific Schema** (`octagon_staffing_schema.py`)
   - Maps to Octagon's organizational structure
   - Handles FTE % â†” hours normalization
   - Tracks billability vs non-billable time
   - Maintains traceability between raw text and structured fields

2. **Enhanced Document Intelligence** (`octagon_document_intelligence.py`)
   - Processes mixed SOW formats (PDF, DOCX)
   - Uses Octagon-specific extraction patterns
   - Integrates heuristics with LLM processing
   - Provides fallback mechanisms for reliability

3. **Taxonomy-Based Processing**
   - Octagon service lines and departments
   - Role mapping and seniority classification
   - Allocation type normalization
   - Financial structure extraction

## Schema Design Principles

### 1. **Flexibility for Variation**
```python
class AllocationType(str, Enum):
    FTE_PERCENTAGE = "fte_percentage"  # % of full-time equivalent
    HOURS = "hours"  # Specific hour allocations
    RATE_BASED = "rate_based"  # Hourly/daily rates
    RETAINER = "retainer"  # Fixed monthly retainer
    PROJECT_BASED = "project_based"  # Fixed project fee
```

### 2. **Normalization Capabilities**
```python
@computed_field
@property
def normalized_hours(self) -> Optional[float]:
    """Convert allocation to normalized hours (assuming 40hr/week for FTE)"""
    if self.allocation_type == AllocationType.HOURS:
        return self.allocation_value
    elif self.allocation_type == AllocationType.FTE_PERCENTAGE:
        if self.project_duration_weeks:
            return (self.allocation_value / 100.0) * 40.0 * self.project_duration_weeks
    return None
```

### 3. **Traceability**
```python
class ExtractedField(BaseModel):
    field_name: str
    raw_text: str  # Original text from SOW
    structured_value: Any  # Normalized value
    confidence_score: float
    source_section: Optional[str]
    extraction_method: Literal["regex", "llm", "heuristic", "manual"]
```

### 4. **Billability Tracking**
```python
class BillabilityType(str, Enum):
    BILLABLE = "billable"  # Direct client billable time
    NON_BILLABLE = "non_billable"  # Internal, overhead time
    PASS_THROUGH = "pass_through"  # Pass-through costs (vendors, etc.)
    UNKNOWN = "unknown"  # Not specified in SOW
```

## Output Schema

### Normalized Staffing Plan Structure
```python
class OctagonStaffingPlan(BaseModel):
    project_info: ProjectInfo  # Client, project name, duration, etc.
    roles: List[StaffingRole]  # Normalized role allocations
    financial_structure: Optional[FinancialStructure]  # Budget, rates, payment terms
    total_billable_hours: Optional[float]
    total_non_billable_hours: Optional[float]
    total_fte_percentage: Optional[float]
    service_line_allocation: Dict[OctagonServiceLine, float]  # FTE by service line
    extraction_confidence: float  # Overall confidence score
    completeness_score: float  # Data completeness score
    source_sow_file: str  # Original file reference
    raw_extraction_data: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]  # Full LLM extraction
```

### Key Output Fields
- **Project Name / Client**: Normalized project identification
- **Service Lines / Departments**: Mapped to Octagon structure
- **Roles & Seniority**: Standardized role titles and levels
- **Hours or FTE**: Normalized allocation (both formats available)
- **Duration**: Project timeline and resource allocation periods
- **Billability**: Classification of time types
- **Notes / Special Instructions**: Context and requirements

## Processing Workflow

### 1. **Document Ingestion**
- Accept mixed formats (PDF, DOCX)
- Extract text using optimized parsers
- Validate document structure

### 2. **Heuristic Extraction**
- Extract basic project information
- Identify staffing plan sections
- Parse role and allocation patterns

### 3. **LLM-Enhanced Extraction**
- Use Octagon-specific prompts
- Extract structured data with confidence scores
- Handle ambiguous or incomplete information

### 4. **Normalization & Validation**
- Map roles to Octagon departments
- Normalize allocations (FTE â†” hours)
- Calculate summary metrics
- Validate completeness

### 5. **Output Generation**

- Provide quality metrics

## Quality Assurance

### Confidence Scoring
- **Extraction Confidence**: Based on LLM certainty and pattern matching
