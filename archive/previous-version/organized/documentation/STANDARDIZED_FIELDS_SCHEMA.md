    - Octagon personnel

### **5. Financial Information**

  - Budget and financial information
  - Sub-fields:
    - `total_budget` (number): Total project budget
    - `budget_currency` (string): Currency (e.g., "USD", "EUR")
    - `budget_breakdown` (array of strings): Budget line items

### **6. Quality & Metadata**
- **`confidence_score`** (number, 0.0-1.0)
  - AI confidence in the extraction accuracy
  - Example: 0.9 (high confidence), 0.7 (good confidence)
  
- **`file_name`** (string)
  - Original SOW file name
  - Example: "company_2_sow_1.pdf"
  
- **`extraction_timestamp`** (datetime)
  - When the extraction was performed
  - ISO format: "2025-09-20T10:02:01.823795"

## ðŸ“Š **Extraction Results Summary**

From the 9 SOW files analyzed:

| Field | Count | Examples |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Companies** | 6 | Company 2, International Incorporated, Company 1, Company 3, Company 4 |
| **Departments** | 4 | client_services, strategy, planning_creative, integrated_production_experiences |
| **Deliverables** | 151 | Partnership planning, PMO management, stakeholder relationships, etc. |
| **Roles** | 63 | Project Manager, Account Director, Creative Director, etc. |
| **Duration Range** | 1-52 weeks | Average: 27.8 weeks, Median: 35 weeks |

## ðŸ”„ **Data Flow**

```
Heterogeneous SOWs â†’ AI Analysis â†’ Standardized JSON â†’ Structured Database
     (9 files)      (Azure OpenAI)    (This Schema)    (Ready for staffing plans)
```

## âœ… **Benefits of Standardization**

1. **Consistency**: All SOWs processed into identical field structure
2. **Queryability**: Standardized fields enable database queries and analysis
3. **Automation**: Consistent data enables automated staffing plan generation
4. **Reporting**: Standardized fields enable cross-project reporting
5. **Integration**: Structured data integrates with downstream systems

## ðŸŽ¯ **Next Steps**

This standardized schema enables:
- **Staffing Plan Generation**: Using roles and departments to create staffing plans
- **Resource Allocation**: Using deliverables and duration to estimate resource needs
- **Budget Planning**: Using budget info and duration for financial planning
- **Department Coordination**: Using departments_involved for cross-team coordination
- **Timeline Management**: Using duration_weeks for project scheduling

The homogeneous extraction from heterogeneous sources is now complete and ready for downstream processing!
