# SOW Taxonomy Analysis & Schema Design

## Executive Summary

After analyzing 9 sample SOWs from your collection, I've identified key patterns and created a comprehensive taxonomy-based schema for intelligently processing non-uniform SOWs. This analysis reveals consistent structures despite varying formats and content complexity.

## Key Findings

### üìä Analysis Results
- **Files Analyzed**: 9 SOWs (5 PDFs, 4 DOCX)
- **Total Text**: 119,030 characters
- **Companies**: 4 different clients (Company 1-4)
- **Industries**: Sports/Entertainment, Hospitality, Partnership Activation, Brand Measurement

### üéØ Critical Patterns Identified

#### 1. **Role Taxonomy** (Most Consistent)
**Top Roles Found:**
- Director (3 occurrences)
- Project Manager (2 occurrences) 
- Coordinator (2 occurrences)
- Vice President (2 occurrences)
- Account Director/Manager (2 occurrences)

**Role Categories:**
- **Account Management**: Account Director, Account Manager
- **Project Management**: Project Manager, Coordinator, SAE, AE
- **Strategy**: Strategist
- **Analytics**: Analyst
- **Executive**: Director, Vice President, VP

#### 2. **Section Structure** (Limited but Consistent)
**Common Sections:**
- Scope of Work (found in 3 SOWs)
- Project Staffing Plan (implicit in all)
- Timeline/Milestones (implicit in all)
- Budget/Financial Terms (implicit in all)

#### 3. **Financial Patterns** (Highly Consistent)
**Fee Structures:**
- Monthly fees (7 occurrences)
- Daily rates (2 occurrences)
- FTE allocations (1 occurrence)
- Retainer-based (implicit in most)

**Budget Categories:**
- Hospitality costs
- Event management
- Vendor coordination
- Travel/transportation

#### 4. **Deliverable Types** (Varied but Categorizable)
**Common Deliverable Categories:**
- **Reports & Analysis**: Brand health reports, competitive intelligence
- **Creative Assets**: Campaign materials, presentations
- **Strategic Documents**: Partnership strategies, activation plans
- **Technical Deliverables**: Budget tracking, vendor management
- **Hospitality Programs**: B2B hospitality, event execution

### üèóÔ∏è Recommended Schema Architecture

#### Core Schema Components

1. **Enhanced Project Information**
   - Basic project metadata
   - Complexity assessment (Simple/Moderate/Complex)
   - Industry domain classification
   - Geographic/regional information

2. **Comprehensive Role Taxonomy**
   - 9 role categories identified
   - 4 seniority levels
   - Allocation percentages
   - Location-specific roles

3. **Structured Deliverable Classification**
   - 8 deliverable types
   - Priority levels (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Success criteria
   - Dependencies and timelines

4. **Financial Structure Modeling**
   - Multiple fee types (hourly/daily/monthly/retainer)
   - FTE allocations by role
   - Pass-through cost categories
   - Budget component breakdown

5. **Timeline and Milestone Tracking**
   - Project phases
   - Key milestones
   - Reporting schedules
   - Dependency mapping

## üöÄ Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Core Schema Integration
1. **Replace existing SOW models** with the comprehensive schema
2. **Enhance Document Intelligence Service** to use taxonomy-based extraction
3. **Update AI prompts** to leverage the structured taxonomy

### Phase 2: AI Enhancement
1. **Implement confidence scoring** for each extraction category
2. **Add completeness validation** to identify missing information
3. **Create taxonomy coverage metrics** for quality assessment

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. **Pattern recognition** for similar SOW types
2. **Automated role mapping** based on historical data
3. **Predictive staffing recommendations** using taxonomy patterns

## üìã Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Test the comprehensive schema** against your sample SOWs
2. **Integrate with existing Document Intelligence Service**
3. **Validate extraction accuracy** with manual review

### Validation Approach
1. **Run enhanced extraction** on all 9 sample SOWs
2. **Compare results** with manual analysis
3. **Refine taxonomy** based on gaps or inconsistencies
4. **Implement confidence scoring** for quality control

## üéØ Expected Benefits

### For Non-Uniform SOW Processing
- **Consistent extraction** regardless of document format
- **Structured output** for all key information types
- **Confidence scoring** to identify extraction quality
- **Completeness validation** to catch missing information

### For AI Intelligence
- **Taxonomy-based prompts** for better AI understanding
- **Pattern recognition** across similar SOW types
- **Historical learning** from processed documents
- **Predictive capabilities** for staffing recommendations

### For Business Value
- **Faster processing** of diverse SOW formats
- **Higher accuracy** in role and deliverable identification
- **Better staffing plan generation** based on structured data
- **Improved decision making** with comprehensive project insights

## üìÅ Files Created

1. **`sow_taxonomy_analyzer.py`** - Analysis script for extracting patterns
2. **`sow_comprehensive_schema.py`** - Complete taxonomy-based schema
3. **`sow_taxonomy_analysis.json`** - Detailed analysis results
4. **`sow_taxonomy_summary.txt`** - Quick reference summary

## üîç Key Insights for Implementation

### What Works Well
- **Role identification** is highly consistent across SOWs
- **Financial structures** follow predictable patterns
- **Project complexity** can be assessed from scope and deliverables
- **Timeline patterns** are extractable despite format variations

### Areas for Improvement
- **Section identification** needs better pattern recognition
- **Deliverable extraction** requires more sophisticated NLP
- **Client information** extraction could be enhanced
- **Risk and assumption** identification needs development

### Recommended AI Enhancements
1. **Multi-pass extraction** - Extract basic info first, then refine
2. **Confidence-based validation** - Flag low-confidence extractions
3. **Cross-reference validation** - Verify consistency across sections
4. **Historical pattern learning** - Improve extraction based on similar SOWs

This taxonomy provides a solid foundation for handling the non-uniform nature of SOWs while maintaining consistency in the extracted structured data.
